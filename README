A small C program to solve sudoku puzzles.  

Tests and optimizations have not been done yet, those are the next steps. Some small tests for the bitwise vector creations would be the first.

Optimize:
    - checking if a puzzle is solved on every iteration of inserting a number
    - instead of randomly selecting a number, randomly select a number that hasn't been used
    - remove resorting to the original puzzle if at all possible

compiling:
    $ make

running: bin/solver tests/input.sudoku

use a command line argument that is the text file of numbers seperated by spaces (9x9).
